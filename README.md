# My Developer Portfolio

## About Me

Hello there! I'm a freshly graduated Junior Developer from Vancouver Island University (VIU). I successfully completed a two-year Diploma program in Web and Mobile Application Development. I am enthusiastic about building dynamic and robust web applications that not only satisfy business needs but also deliver outstanding user experiences.

## About the Project

This portfolio is an exhibit of my journey in coding, featuring the projects I've worked on, and serving as a platform to reach out to me. As a recent graduate, I am eager to demonstrate my skills and capabilities through the projects I've developed, which range from simple static websites to dynamic and interactive web applications. The website has three main pages: Home, Projects, and Contact.

- **Home Page**: It serves as the introduction page, highlighting my skills, education and a brief about me.
- **Projects Page**: This page displays the projects I have worked on, with live links and code repositories for each.
- **Contact Page**: You can find ways to connect with me here, be it for potential job opportunities, projects or even coding discussions!

## Tech Stack

Building this portfolio, I've utilized a modern and efficient tech stack:

- **Next.js**: This is a powerful React framework that allows for server-side rendering, enabling blazing-fast website load times and improved SEO performance.
- **TypeScript**: I chose TypeScript for static typing, helping me write safer, self-documenting code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, I've used Tailwind CSS, which is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level classes allowing rapid prototyping and development.
- **Node.js**: Leveraging the power of Node.js for a serverless backend, keeping the portfolio lightweight yet robust.
- **Vercel**: The portfolio is hosted on Vercel, providing an excellent CI/CD environment, and ensuring the website remains live and accessible.

The portfolio showcases my proficiency in these technologies and exemplifies my approach towards efficient and clean coding practices. It serves as a testament to my development skills and my journey thus far as a developer.

## Hosting the Portfolio

This portfolio is hosted on Vercel, which provides an ideal environment for hosting Next.js applications with great features like incremental static regeneration and serverless functions. It's straightforward to deploy on Vercel directly from a GitHub repository.
